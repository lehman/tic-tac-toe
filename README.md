# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The base of it was to go through the react tutorial at [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), including implementing the improvements they list at the end of the tutorial, and then I added additional features and flexibility to the app.

### Improvements from Tutorial
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

### Additional Features
- The tic-tac-toe board is designed to support any dimension _n x n_, rather than just _3 x 3_
